<h1>About</h1>
<p>I'm Barney. I'm a programmer and data junkie. I trust you to be every bit as
    smart as you are. I'm not much for babying; I'd rather design for intent.
</p>
<p>COVID-19 and population data from the
    <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">COVID-19 Data
        Repository</a> by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE)
    at Johns Hopkins University.
</p>
<p>You can drop me a line at <a href="mailto:c19d@barneyb.com">c19d@barneyb.com</a>
    if you'd like to get in touch. Or call me, though you'll need to your own
    digging for that one. If you find my Twitter account, don't expect a
    response. Any likely matches on other social networks are false.
</p>
<hr />
<p>All data are updated daily, about 5:20am UTC, including any historical
    corrections. That's CSSE's schedule, plus a handful of minutes on my end to
    hopefully avoid missing updates.
</p>
<p>Weekly figures are labeled by their final day, anchored to today. If you come
    back tomorrow, everything will be shifted forward one day. There's no way
    to get a "weeks starting Sunday" (or whatever day you wish) sort of view;
    they are always anchored to today with rolling week boundaries.
</p>
<p>Series with "Rate" in their name are <em>per day</em> per 100K population.
    Even when looking at a weekly view. When you want to compare a daily figure
    against a weekly table, you'll thank me for the table showing a daily
    average over the week, instead of seven times that figure.
</p>
<hr />
<p>The tech stack is very simple:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>CSSE's repo of CSV files</li>
    <li>a Java utility aggregates, indexes, and transforms the data</li>
    <li>a JS client presents the data</li>
</ol>
<p>Parts two and three are available at
    <a href="https://github.com/barneyb/covid-report">https://github.com/barneyb/covid-report</a>
    if you want source. The Java binary you'll have to build yourself. There is
    no build process for the client. The Java code uses Spring, Jackson, Lombok,
    and OpenCSV. The client code is entirely mine.
</p>
<p>Note that if you go poking in the code, I have deliberately <em>not</em>
    looked to following reasonable development practices. This is a personal
    project, and primarily about playing <em>with the code</em>. Finding the
    pain points that drive the best practices in a toy project is exactly the
    sort of thing. This is also the first time I'd ever used Lombok or Java's
    new-ish functional pieces, as I've always looked to Groovy for similar
    features (along with its meta-programming voodoo).
</p>
<p>All of the infrastructure pieces are also present in the Github repository,
    aside from the <code>cron</code> config:
</p>
<pre>    17 21 * * * $COVID_ROOT/hopkins/refresh.sh</pre>
<p>Yes, I use the cron email as notification of new data. It works. Yes, I run
    my box on my local time, not UTC. That one is less graceful. I am hoping the
    whole pandemic thing will be over before fall's DST transition.
